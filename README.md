# Pizza

## Ingredients:

* 700ml tap water (better if let sit for a few mins so the chlorine evaporated and doesn’t bother the growth)
* 1 Kg flour (better Manitoba or any strong protein one)
* 1.5 gr dry yeast
* 25/30gr salt

## Steps:

1. Pour the water in a big bowl and dissolve salt in in it at room temperature. Dissolve also the yeast in a little cup with some room temperature water that has been let sit for a min too.

2. Slowly add the flour into the water and mix with a spoon, trying to gently incorporate as much air as possible. It is important to add a few parts of flour per time. Keep pouring flour into the water and mix till you have used 2/3 of the flour. Now add the yeast, the rest of the flour and mix everything. It has come the moment to abandon the spoon and start with the hands.

3. Put everything on a smooth surface with some flour and leave it sitting for 30 mins so that it relaxes.

4. After this time, by helping yourself with some little flour, knead the dough with your hands till it becomes pretty smooth and uniform. Do not overwork the dough. Now cover everything with the bowl or with a moist cloth and let it rise for 2 hrs in a warm place and without air currents.
 
5. After the 2 hours have passed you can create an elongated shape from the dough and from this you should be able to shape 5/6 little buns. Put them in a large baking tray and cover.

6. From this moment you have two options. Either you leave the buns proofing outside of the fridge for at least 6 hrs (no more than 8) or, you can put the tray with the buns for up to 12 hours in the fridge and then take it outside just 3/4 hours before you want to eat the pizzas.

7. When you are ready, bring the oven at the highest temperature it can reach, volcano level. And leave a tray very close to the upper grill (it has to be glowing orange). It is important that the tray is a metal or ceramic one that can go on  a stovetop burner and that has very shallow edges to stretch the pizza in.

8. While the oven is reaching critical temperatures, on a surface create your pizzas. Tap with your fingertips from the center to the outer part of the dough. The center should be very thin. NEVER, EVER, EVER touch the edges (you want to push air bubbles by tapping toward the edges). Every time you touch the edges with your fingertips, someone in Naples dies. Now put on the pizza whatever toppings you desire. 
I will pretend I won’t be there judging you. 

## Suggested toppings:

Peeled tomatoes crushed with fork and slightly salted. Some kind of “mozzarella” (big chunks so that doesn’t burn). Basil, under the mozzarella and on top of tomato. Olive oil and some Parmesan. 


Take the tray out of the oven and Gently lift and stretch the pizza onto the hot tray. Transfer it on stovetop burner turned on medium/high heat. Cook till you start see the bottom of the pizza cools and slightly scorched in places. When is done, transfer the tray again under the glowing grill and cook it for another minute and a half or two mins, till it gets bubbly on the sides and dark spots appear. 

P.S. If you have a oven that reaches high temperatures you can cook at the highest one possible and close to the grill, so to avoid the use of the stovetop burner. 

**Enjoy!**
